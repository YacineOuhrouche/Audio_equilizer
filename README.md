This code creates a real-time audio equalizer application using PyQt5 for the GUI and PyAudio for audio input/output. It allows users to adjust the gain of three frequency bands—Low, Mid, and High—using horizontal sliders. The equalizer applies a bandpass filter to the incoming audio stream in real-time, and the gain adjustments for each frequency band are reflected instantly on the audio output
